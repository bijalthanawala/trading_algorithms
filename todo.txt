Todo / wish list

Reliability
- Write unit tests

Performance and resource usage
- Utilize multiprocessing
- Avoid reading up all the rows from CSV files

Configurability
- Read runtime-arguments from config file (json/yaml), instead of from the command line
- Make minimum and maximum hold-times configurable at command-line
  i.e. Design a new command-line switch to show individual algorithm's doc string
