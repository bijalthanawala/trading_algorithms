Todo / wish list
- Write unit tests
- Read runtime-arguments from config file (json/yaml), instead of from the command line
- Use multiprocessing for parallel computing
- Avoid reading up all the rows from CSV files
- It would be better if TradingAlgorithms constructor raised exception!
- Make explanation of individual algorithms visible to the user.
  Serve individual algorithm's doc string with some new command-line switch.
